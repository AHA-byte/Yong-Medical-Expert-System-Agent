# DxGPT Medical Expert System

This project is a medical expert system agent designed to provide differential diagnosis suggestions based on user-provided symptoms. It leverages AI models and external APIs to deliver concise, evidence-based results for clinical triage.

## Features
- Differential diagnosis for 4â€“10 symptoms
- Probability-based ranking of diagnoses
- Rationale and red flags for urgent care
- Secure API key management via `.env` file
- Integration with OpenAI and DXGPT APIs

## Setup
1. **Clone the repository:**

   git clone https://github.com/AHA-byte/Yong-Medical-Expert-System-Agent.git
   cd Yong-Medical-Expert-System-Agent
   ```
2. **Install dependencies:**
   ```powershell
   pip install -r requirements.txt
